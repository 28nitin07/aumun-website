        <h1>Letter from the Secretary General</h1>
        <p>Dear Delegates,</p>
        <p>I am honoured to be serving as the Secretary-General at the second iteration of the AUMUN to be held on the 18th and 19th of March, 2023. Having had the pleasure to work with and learn from the former Secretary-General, Ishaan Khosla, leading and organizing this conference offline is an immense undertaking.</p>
        <p>In this iteration, we extend our reach to bring together students from universities across India to fuse a diverse range of experiences into rich and lively debates borne across committees. Dedicated to simulating fascinating and thought-provoking conversations, the OC is working hard to bring together experienced Model UN Executive Board members. Espousing critical thinking and international diplomacy at the core, I urge you to bring your best to this conference as the two days hold in store the opportunity to explore a range of issues inspired in the light of the pandemic, where diplomacy gained a new currency bringing together actors around the globe to re-think critical issues. This conference will tie together the threads of new debates, including the role of nascent technologies and how it shapes communication, and revisit pivotal dialogues around terrorism and peace while bringing light on Child Labour laws in India. </p>
        <p>Working relentlessly to make the field of International Relations accessible and approachable - the core belief of the AUMUN - they are some of the most hardworking and passionate individuals I’ve had the pleasure of working with. It is with distinct pleasure and faith in delivering a conference where you will leave with an unparalleled experience, that I invite you to this rendition of the AUMUN ‘23.</p>
        <p>I look forward to interacting with you all.</p>
        <p>Yours Sincerely</p>
        <p>Tejaswini Vondivillu</p>
        <p>Secretary-General</p>
        <p>AUMUN 2023</p>
