    <div id="about">
        <h3>Making International Relations Accessible and Approachable</h2>
        <p>The Ashoka MUN Club was built on the founding principles of creating a space to make international relations and politics more accessible to students. Here, we strive to engage students in meaningful debates, deliberations and writing to open the work of politics and policies to everyone. We are currently undertaking various projects such as: our very own Newsletter, Podcast and Policy Briefs in addition to our very own annual conference Ashoka University Model United Nations (AUMUN). We also conduct our very sought after project 'The Table' - our flagship round-table conference which gives students the unique opportunity to discuss topics of global importance with each other and expert panellists.</p>
        <p> We welcome you to the Ashoka Model United Nations Club Society!</p>
